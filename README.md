# Team-Profile-Generator
A webpage generator that displays employee info


I created an app that enables users to dynamically generate a html page with styling that displays employee information, including Manager, Engineers and Interns. The project uses the command line interface, node and inquirer. 

This solves the issue of displaying different kinds of employee information via inquirer prompts which are both recursive and conditional dependent upon the employee type.

Download the repo and open in VS Code. 

Ensure the relevant dependencies are in the file: inquirer, jest and node. (Else these can be accessed by typing 'npm init -y, npm i inquirer, npm i jest seperately in the command line)



## Usage 

For running tests, navigate to the test file inside the tests folder, open in integrated terminal and type 'npm test' to run the tests.

To generate the html, open the command line by opening index.js in integrated terminal. type 'node index.js' and answer the questions. Navigate to output/team.html and open live server.
